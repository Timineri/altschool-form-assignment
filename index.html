      Hi! I'm Princess Timineri Okoko, a student of Altschool Africa in the
      School of Engineering, Front-end Engineering Track with Student ID
      ALT/SOE/023/3019. I've got a first degree in Computer Science and i'm
      passionate about technology hence striving to develop my knowledge in
      Front-end Engineering to become a world class engineer and that's my
      reason for joining Altschool. <br />
      I plan to achieve a Diploma certificate at the end of this experience that
      will broaden my chances of getting a Front-end developer role in a good
      company.
